# Architectural Sketch To 3D Printing
Take a single architectural sketch as input and generate a ready-to-print 3D model.

## Dataset Preparation
### Simple House Dataset Generator
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Petingo/Architectural-Sketch-To-3D-Printing/master/imgs/simple-house-same-wh.gif)
- `simple_house_generator.py`: A grasshopper script for generating the "Simple House" dataset, which the structure is similiar to the `shapenet-synthetic` dataset from [sketch2model](https://github.com/bennyguo/sketch2model).

### Post processing
- `obj2sketch.py`: A grasshopper script for generating rendered image of the 3d model generated by the [Building-Dataset-Generator](https://github.com/CDInstitute/Building-Dataset-Generator)
- `obj2voxel.py`: Convert generated .obj file to voxel, which has the same structure as `shapenet-synthetic` dataset.
- `postprocess_sketch.py`: Process the sketch exported by Rhino into the form of sketch in `shapenet-synthetic` dataset.
- `voxel_test.py`: Visualizer for `voxel.mat`

### Utilities
- `angle_evaluation.py`: A grasshopper script which takes azimuth and elevation as input and orient Rhino's view.
